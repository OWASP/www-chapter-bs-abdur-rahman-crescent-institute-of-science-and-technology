## Overview
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects ,tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security.
OWASP B.S. Abdur Rahman Crescent Institute of Science and Technology is a Student Chapter which focuses on providing maximum Web Application Security 
knowledge, Ethical Hacking Skills, OSINT, Knowledge on different types of exploitations,Malware Analysis and other skills to students. Members will get to know about Cyber Laws and Policies. Members will learn Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration Testing and will get to know how to get bounties from Vulnerability Reward Programs (VRP) provided by various companies.

The number of unfilled cybersecurity jobs worldwide grew 350% between 2013 and 2021,from 1 million to 3.5 million, according to Cybersecurity Ventures.
